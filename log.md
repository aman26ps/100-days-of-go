# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about path seperator,path package library, use and misuse of the blank identifier,shadowing example and scope of a variable, type conversion best practices
                    os package, how to take input from the terminal.

**Thoughts:** Its overwhelming to start this journey as i have a problem with consistency but commiting it to public might help, but golang is very interesting and full of surprises :)
